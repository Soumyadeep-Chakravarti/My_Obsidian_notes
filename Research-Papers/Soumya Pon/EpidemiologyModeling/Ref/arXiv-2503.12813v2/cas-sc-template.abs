The novel Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, was declared by World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic On March 11th, 2020. Originating in Wuhan, Hubei province in China around December 2019, it has dramatically spread over the world and brought new challenges to the governments and the research community. Handling the huge number of infected people and managing the available resources effectively has become a crucial task for healthcare systems. Therefore, accurate short-term prediction of the number of infected, cured, and dead people can help the authorities improve managing the available resources. Recently, considerable research attention has been paid to the use of deep learning models in forecasting time-series data.  This paper presents a hybrid deep learning model, composed of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict the number of infected, cured, and dead people in twenty-four countries from six continents. Moreover, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the proposed method. Comparing the results demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.
