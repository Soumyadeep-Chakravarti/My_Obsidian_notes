# üß†üîåüí£ **Expanded Project Title:**

### **‚ÄúNeuroHacker++: Offensive AI-Assisted Red Teaming Against Brain-Computer Interfaces Through Signal Injection, Protocol Exploits, and Hardware Hacking‚Äù**

---

## üéØ Refined Goal:

> To **design and simulate offensive attacks** on low-cost Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems by using **adversarial AI to generate malicious EEG signals**, **hardware-level signal injection**, and **protocol/driver exploits**, demonstrating how such systems could be manipulated to misinterpret user intent or trigger unintended behaviors.

---

## üß© Major Innovation:

This project turns **AI into an attacker**, not a defender ‚Äî which is **unexplored in the context of BCIs**, especially at the college level. It also brings **EE-level attack vectors** (analog/digital injections, EMI, firmware fuzzing) into the red teaming process.

## üí• Attack Surface Overview

|Layer|Component|Attack Vector|
|---|---|---|
|Electrical (EE)|Analog EEG electrodes, signal conditioning, ADC|Signal injection, cross-talk, EM interference|
|Firmware|Microcontroller firmware / bios|Firmware modification, memory corruption|
|Protocol|USB/Bluetooth data transport|Packet injection, replay, malformed packet fuzzing|
|AI Model|EEG classifier|Adversarial signal crafting, gradient-based evasion|

## üß™ Breakdown of Each Subsystem

---

### üîå **Electrical Engineering (EE) Focus**

#### üß† 1. **BCI Signal Path Attack**

- Build or simulate EEG frontend using:
    
    - ADS1299 ADC (24-bit medical-grade) or cheaper 10‚Äì12-bit analog signal acquisition.
        
    - Op-amps, filters (LPF, BPF) for brainwave isolation (alpha, beta).
        
- **Attack**:
    
    - Inject synthetic EM signals into EEG leads via antenna near scalp or wires.
        
    - Create low-frequency interference that biases signal.
        
    - Use _conducted injection_ (through power supply lines) to bias signal pre-ADC.
        

#### üß† 2. **Power and Crosstalk Injection**

- Interfere with shared ground or Vcc lines to induce coupling into signal chain.
    
- Use Arduino/DAC to generate fake brainwave patterns.
    
- Explore DC offset shifts that subtly distort analog signal integrity.
    

#### üß† 3. **Side-channel Leakage**

- Analyze EM radiation from BCI device.
    
- Use SDR (Software-Defined Radio) to sniff unintended emissions that correlate with EEG activity.
    

---

### üíª **CS Core (Firmware, Protocol, and Stack Attacks)**

#### üß† 4. **Firmware & USB Stack Exploits**

- Access microcontroller firmware (OpenBCI, NeuroSky, Muse) if available.
    
- Apply fuzzers (like AFL) to:
    
    - Overflow signal buffers.
        
    - Inject malformed USB/Bluetooth packets.
        
- Simulate DoS (denial of signal delivery), or hijack data stream with altered timing.
    

#### üß† 5. **Replay & Packet Injection**

- Capture real EEG session using USB sniffer.
    
- Inject crafted EEG data to simulate fake "intentions" (e.g., left move ‚Üí right).
    
- Target serial-over-USB, BLE, or ESP32 data transmission.
    

---

### ü§ñ **CS AIML (AI-Assisted Offense)**

#### üß† 6. **Adversarial EEG Signal Generation (AI = Attacker)**

- Train a CNN/LSTM classifier for intent prediction (e.g., blink = click).
    
- Use **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)** or **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)** to craft **EEG signals that force misclassification**.
    

##### Example:

> Generate an EEG waveform that the system misreads as a "relax" signal when in fact the person is in high-alert state.

#### üß† 7. **Black-Box Model Attacks**

- If the BCI uses closed-source model (e.g., in commercial headsets):
    
    - Use **transfer attacks** with surrogate models.
        
    - Perform model inversion to infer user's state from output.
        

#### üß† 8. **AI-Based Fuzzer for EEG Protocol**

- Build a **neuro-protocol fuzzer** powered by reinforcement learning.
    
- Train an agent to inject EEG packets that slowly desync the BCI without crashing the stack.
