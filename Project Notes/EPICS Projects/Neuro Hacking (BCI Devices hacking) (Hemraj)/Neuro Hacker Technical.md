# NeuroHacker++: Offensive AI-Assisted Red Teaming of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)

---

> 🎯 **Objective:**  
> To explore and develop AI-powered offensive red-teaming strategies targeting vulnerabilities in modern Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), including EEG-based wearables and implantables, through a combination of signal spoofing, protocol exploits, and hardware-level manipulation.

---

## 1. 🧠 Introduction

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that enable direct communication between a user's brain and an external device. While they promise incredible applications—from medical prosthetics to gaming and mental health—they also open an **entirely new attack surface**: the human mind.

### Why Red Team BCIs?

🔴 Unlike traditional devices, **BCIs connect directly to neural activity**. Malicious actors could:

- Inject false signals (e.g., to simulate intent or emotion)
    
- Extract private neurological data
    
- Exploit firmware/hardware vulnerabilities in BCI headsets
    

This project envisions a **red team simulation** environment where attackers are assisted by AI models to intelligently plan and launch such attacks.
