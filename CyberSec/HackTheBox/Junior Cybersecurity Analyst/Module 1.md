- `Client`: This is a PC/Laptop through which you access resources and services "on the Internet".
    
- `Internet`: This is a vast, interconnected network of servers that offer different services and applications, such as Hack The Box.
    
- `Servers`: Servers provide various services and applications designed to perform specific tasks. For example, one type of server might be a "web server", allowing you and others to view the content of a website (such as this section you're reading currently) on your computer or smartphone.
    
- `Network`: When multiple servers or computers are connected and can communicate with each other, it's called a network.
    
- `Cloud`: Cloud refers to data centers that offer interconnected servers for companies and individuals to use.
    
- `Blue Team`: This team is responsible for the internal security of the company and defends against cyber attacks.
    
- `Red Team`: This team simulates an actual adversary/attack on the company.
    
- `Purple Team`: This team consists of both Blue Team and Red Team members working together to enhance the company's security.
  
  
Visulaize it as 

- `The Treasure`: Your valuable data and information.
- `The Castle Walls`: Firewalls, defensive mechanisms, and encryption that keep outsiders from getting in.
- `The Guards`: Security protocols and access controls that monitor who enters and leaves.
- `Penetration Testers`: Knights who test the castle's defenses by simulating attacks to find weak spots.
- `Digital Transformation`: Expanding the castle to store more treasure, which attracts more thieves.
- `Cyber Threats`: Thieves who are constantly looking for ways to breach the castle's defenses.


Just as a castle must strengthen its defenses as it grows and becomes a more valuable target, businesses must enhance their InfoSec measures as they move more services online. By thinking of InfoSec as a building or fortress to protect, it becomes easier to understand the importance of strong security in the digital age.
